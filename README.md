## Future Plans

- Add relevant background color depending on the time till next shuttle
  - i.e. If no shuttle for next 10 hours, it will be red
- Modularity should be improved
  - code is not as DRY as it could be
- Show only relevant pictures depending on selected stop
  - i.e. If user chooses 1200 Seaport Blvd as stop, then only the map, caltrain pick up, and 1200 pick up stop image will show up
